<a name="Installation"></a>
# Installation

**Swift Package Manager** (XCode 13)

1. Select **File** > **Swift Packages** > **Add Package Dependencyâ€¦** from the **File** menu.
2. Paste `https://github.com/dyerlab/DabSpatial.git` in the dialog box.
3. Follow the Xcode's instruction to complete the installation.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or blank?

Supporting multiple dependency managers makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.  Since, the **Swift Package Manager** is integrated with Xcode 11 (and greater), it's the easiest choice to support going further.
